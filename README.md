# Encryption-and-Hashing

A symmetric algorithm is a class of cipher that uses a single key, identcal keys or closely releted key. 
Symmetric Algorithm include: 
 1. Data Encryption stadard (DES) uses about 64 bit key size
 2. Triple DES (3DES) uses 168 bit 
 3. Advenced Encyption Standard (AES) 256 bits
 4. River Cipher Version 4 (RC4) typically 128 bit size
 5. River Cipher Version 5 (RC5) typically 64 bit size
 6. River Cipher Version 6 (RC6)  typically 256 bit size
 7. Twofish key size range from 128, 192, and 256 bits
